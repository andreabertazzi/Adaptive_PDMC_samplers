# Adaptive_PDMC_samplers
In this repository one finds all the codes relative to the paper "Adaptive schemes for Piecewise Deterministic Monte Carlo algorithms" by Andrea Bertazzi & Joris Bierkens. The preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13924 .

The folder **Julia** contains implmentations in Julia of the adaptive Zig-Zag sampler and of the adaptive Bouncy Particle sampler (with and without subsampling), as well as the functions to run the experiments discussed in the paper. The folder **box_plots** contains R codes to produce boxplots as the ones in the paper.
